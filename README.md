# What is MF styling ?

Kinda CSS framework to create minimalistic web sites like:

 - https://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com
 - http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com
 - https://evenbettermotherfucking.website
 - https://thebestmotherfucking.website
 
Also you can use it for a web sites without "motherfucking" word in their domain name too.


# Why are you doing this?

Developers are already bitching about over bloating CSS/JS framework and huge web site pages size.
Many years ago I tried to fight with the same stuff.
So why not try to apply my 20years old knowledge today.

# What is this?

## mf-fix.css

In the IE6 era I found out that web browsers had different defaults for styling HTML elements
and different default fonts as well.

So this file purpose it to eliminate those differences to make all HTML look almost the same.

## mf-fonts.css

Set of a web safe fonts that should make you text to have a similar appearance on different platforms.
So there will be no need to download custom fonts with your website pages.

## mf-layout.css

More advanced formatting and custom styling.
Optional stuff mostly, not required if you are planning to design everything by yourself.

## index.html

File with pangramms to test CSS layouts.


# Development plan?

 - Polish mf-fix
 - Improve default fonts sets based on current OS fonts
 - Other thing
